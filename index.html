					 	Activity  recognition  fits  within  the  bigger  framework
    					of context awareness.  In this project,  we report on our
					    efforts  to  recognize  user  activity  from  accelerometer
					    data. The human physical activities which we have considered for our
					    classification are standing, sitting, walking, cycling, stairs climbing and running.
					    Firstly, we have done feature extraction from our data and this is further interpreted
					    by various machine learning Algorithms. The basic machine learning task involves classifying
					    a tri-axial time series as a single physical activity type.

					  Our key motivation for this project is the accurate and detailed measurement of an 
				      individual's physical activity. Researchers can use this data to identify people at risk 
				      of certain disease and understand why some group of people are physically healthier 
				      than others.<br>
				      Here, we aim to develop a classifier algorithm that which on giving input from a 
				      triaxial accelerometer can report the activity of the subject.

					Accelerometer is the most regularly used sensors for activity detection, since accurate data can be obtained from an acclerometer. 
					Action recognition is done by initially requesting the subjects to perform the required exercises, which 
					are analyzed by the classifier for further detection of the same activities, and feature components are extracted from 
					the recorded sensor data for the machine learning calculations to represent the information better. There have 
					been numerous other implementations in the area of activity detection. Each of the studies utilizes various sensors at 
					distinct locations, with different components extracted and calculated against different machine learning algorithms 
					yielding  distinct  results  for  each  trial.  It  is  discovered  that  exercises  can  be  recognized  by  utilizing 
					moderately few elements. The studies have also been performed to see if using more components will 
					produce better results

							The experiments have been carried out with a group of volunteers within an age group of 20-24 years.
							Each person performed 6 activities (SITTING, WALKING, STAIRS CLIMBING, RUNNING, STANDING, CYCLING ) wearing a 3 axial accelerometer on the waist that captured 3-axial linear acceleration.
							Notation of axis:
							X axis -> front / backward motion
							Y axis -> upward and downward motion
							Z axis -> left / right motion 
							No. of dataset collected 9
							Each data set includes listed 3 activities having time interval of 150 seconds for every activity.

							The features which we have used in our feature extraction are:
							Mean, Standard deviation, Coefficient of variation, Skewness, Kurtosis, Data below 25 and 75 percentile, and log one auto correlation.

							Through this project, we have tried to distinguish among various human activities such as sitting,walking,running,cycling,standing and stairs climbing. We considered some metrics by which feature extraction was performed. Later, SVM classifiers were used to train the model.

							<p>We found that activities can be recognized with fairly high
								accuracy  using  a  single  triaxial  accelerometer.   Activities
								that are limited to the movement of just hands or mouth (e.g
								brushing) are comparatively harder to recognize using a sin-
								gle accelerometer worn near the pelvic region.
								An interesting extension would be to see whether ”short
								activities” (e.g opening the door with a swipe card) can be
								recognized from accelerometer data
